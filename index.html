        <!--About-us title -->

        <p class="animate__animated animate__slideInRight animate__delay-3s"> Welcome to the website of Aid Colombian Children, a non-profit organisation in Colombia dedicated
            exclusively to the benefit of children who suffer from malaria and who, as a result of drug wars,have been
            forced to leave their homes.
            Founded in 2022, Its objective is to provide assistance to these children through the provision of
            assistance related to their health and accomodation(housing) needs.
            Our mission is to help children recover from malaria by providing them with free medical care,
            free mosquito nets for school students and
            anti-malaria medication for small children as well as other information about how children can protect
            themselves from mosquitoes.
            The children we are helping are from the poorest villages of Colombia. Many of them are living with malaria
            and other diseases because there is no medicine for them in the village.
            We recognize their pain and help our children to find a safe home and an opportunity to heal, both
            physically and emotionally

                <p>Every year, malaria kills thousands of children in Colombia. Most of these deaths are preventable
                    with a simple intervention: prescription malaria pills for kids. At Aid Colombian Children, we’re working to end
                    this tragedy by providing free medication to children living in remote areas. We partner with local
                    clinics, to ensure that the children are healthy.

                <p>The children of Colombia have become tragically familiar with the devastating disease of dengue.
                    This compassion inspired us to share the love that we had in a way that was more tangible, by
                    providing free medical supplies that are aimed
                    at improving the overall health conditions of these children afflicted with dengue fever. </p>

                    Don’t let another child suffer because of a conflict and drug wars.
                    Help us provide medical supplies to children living in areas where violence is widespread.
                   These children lost their parents to conflicts and drug wars.
                    When children get hurt, everyone gets hurt. But that's no excuse for
                    what happened to these children in Colombia. Children are not the ones who create wars.
